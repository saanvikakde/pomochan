# Pomochan: Your Productivity Assistant 
Introducing Pomochan, a Chrome extension designed for focused studying that combines the Pomodoro technique with a wholesome, built-in AI assistant. In today’s digital-first education landscape, distraction is one of the biggest challenges, especially for younger students learning online. While schools often respond with restrictive measures, Pomochan takes a different approach: it empowers students by placing the power back in their hands. With a cutesy cat assistant as a study buddy, Pomochan aims to spark intrinsic motivation and reward focus through a gentle, familiar tool: the Pomodoro timer.
